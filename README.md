# Playlister App

In this course, I learned about the Fundamentals of Software Development and developed my first CRUD Web Application for entering and editing data associated with music playlists called Playlister. <br>

## Homework 1:
- In this assignment, I learned the basics of HTML/CSS and Javascript. I created my first web application using pure HTML and Javascript without any frameworks.

## Homework 2:
- For the second assignment, I learned to use a front-end framework called React to make front-end GUI creation easier. I essentially did homework 1 over again but with React. I also learned how to implement undo and redo transactions to save to a browser's local storage.

## Homework 3:
- For the third assignment, I learned to implement a back-end for my Playlister App. I utilized MongoDB as my database, built a back-end API using Express, and used Contexts and Hook APIs in our frontend to send HTTP requests to the backend API using Axios.

## Homework 4:
- For the fourth assignment, I created a login system for my Playlister App. Each person that uses the website can create their own account, login/logout of it, and make their own playlists. 

## Final-Project:
- The last assignment, known as the Final Project, is the sum of everything that I learned in these 4 assignments and where I finalize one complete web application.
